++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|
Only one of the character was typed to the screen when we enable the
keyboard init and keyboard_handler. We have some trouble to find where the
bug was located, and we ask TA during the office hour, and found out that
the keyboard handler portion where we check if the scancode is within the 
alphanurmeric range was preventing an eoi if we just return. So we made a
change to that portion of the code, by adding some if statements and send 
eoi functionalities.

Our RTC have similiar issue as the one we had with keyboard_handler, where
only one of interrupt was recieved by the operating system. We also asked 
TA during the office hour regarding this issue, and she believe that its 
reg c in RTC causing some sort of problems, we need to make sure we are 
reading from a certain rtc register in order for it to send another 
interrupt. Later, we found out that all we need is to add linkage.

Paging is crashing the kernel. The fix was changing the order of the
control register enabling.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|
The keyboard and the rtc was not working properly. The problem was that the
interrupt was not working properly and it was only handling a single interrupt.
We realized that we did not include the linkages for the interrupt handlers
so the c calling convention was messing up the interrupts.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++|
When test our rtc driver functionalities (read, write, open, and close),
the character was only printed in the first line of our terminal, because 
wer use putc to print our character, we checked the putc fcuntion in the 
lib.c to see how it work. Later, we found that there's two lines of code 
that were flipped, which is the reason of why it does not go to new line 
after fill up the first line of the terminal.
changed:
screen_y = (screen_y + (screen_x / NUM_COLS)) % NUM_ROWS;
screen_x %= NUM_COLS;
